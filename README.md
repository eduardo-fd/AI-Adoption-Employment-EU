## Introduction
**Are we fully aware of the impact that Artificial Intelligence is having on the employment structure?**

The rapid adoption of AI in today‚Äôs economy has generated uncertainty about the future of the labor market.
Historically, automation has produced a heterogeneous substitution effect in employment structures, depending on the type of tasks most susceptible to being replaced by machines.
However, it has also led to the creation of new tasks, increasing the demand for labor in other areas and thus driving a structural shift in employment.

In this context, the question arises:

**Will artificial intelligence follow a similar pattern of previous technological advances?**

## üéØ Project Objective

The objective of this research is to empirically analyze how the adoption of AI technologies by firms is affecting the employment structure in Europe. Specifically, this impact will be examined across different branches of economic activity (NACE Rev. 2 classification) and occupational groups (ISCO-08 classification) for the period 2023‚Äì2024.

To achieve this, the central hypothesis is that the adoption of AI will have a heterogeneous effect on employment depending on the predominant type of tasks. In particular, drawing on the theoretical framework of routine vs. non-routine tasks, it is expected that in sectors and occupations intensive in routine tasks, AI adoption will be associated with reductions in employment shares. Conversely, in sectors and occupations intensive in non-routine tasks, AI is likely to act more as a complement to human labor, leading to higher employment shares as AI adoption increases.
